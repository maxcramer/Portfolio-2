            Iâ€™ve been coding almost daily in my free time outside of work, focusing on ReactJS and Google Firebase. I believe during this time, I have become a more confident developer. I am currently attempting to grow my skills with a course on Udemy in ReactJS & React Native. I enjoy working in a team, especially with more senior developers, doing code reviews with me, allowing me to always learn from their experience. I believe that code is the future, I look around and everything we use today involves code one way or another. I want to be a part of that industry and to help it grow.
