            During my time at Uncrowd, I was given a task to build a mock
            version of the data analytics platform, and gamify it. I was in
            charge of the Front End and decided to use React.js, as I had not
            had the chance to use it recently, while one of my colleagues did
            the back end in PHP. We were given just over a week to build the
            platform, ready to be used at NRF New York. <br />
            The business would promote itself by giving their clients well
            designed, branded t-shirts. One of my projects while at Uncrowd was
            designing and building a website that the clients could order the
            t-shirts from directly from. This was built using React.js and
            Google Firebase. <br />
            Our data collection application was a web application designed for
            use on mobiles. We were trying to emulate it to look as if while you
            were filling out the data, to anyone else, would look like you are
            messaging a friend on whatsapp. I designed the UI using Sketch.{" "}
            <br />I also was tasked into researching Websockets, and
            implementing onto the platform. Websockets were something I had no
            previous experience with but always happy to try and learn. Day to
            day I would be writing A/B tests, as well as working on the front
            end of the data analytics platform.

            I started on an initial agreement of three months working for free
            while getting trained up, and the company gained financial backing.
            Unfortunately, the company was unable to raise any funds. <br />
            Here I used Angluar7 and Docker. It is likely that if we didnâ€™t have
            bills to pay I would still be there as did very much enjoy the work
            as well as the community atmosphere.

            This was a short term contract to help juniors get started on AEM
            (which I had previous experience using while at Golin). Here they
            had access to the JavaScript files in AEM, using jQuery. <br /> I
            also had the opportunity of learning how to use Oracle Maximyser for
            A/B Testing. After two months had come to an end and due to lack of
            desk space, were unable to extend my contract.
